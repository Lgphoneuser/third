   I graduated from Colonial Forge High School Class of 2012 in Stafford, Va with an Advanced Diploma.
   In the Fall of 2012 I started attending community college part time and did so for a couple of years.
   In 2015 I stopped attending college and started working full time to support myself.
   My dad has an Associates as a Computer Engineer. My mom does not have a formal education beyond high school.
   My goal is to one day be a Computer Programmer.
   With that being said, don't have a target transfer college picked out as of right now. I am just getting back into things and taking it one step at a time.

   Computer Programming is what I've always wanted to do, I love it. Writing programs, coding, testing them and making them work is a really fun experience for me.
   Back in high school I took two programming classes. My absolute favorite one was Visual Basic! I learned that programming language very well!
   I would go above and beyond in my assignments and add extra features into the programming that I would create.
   I had a lot of fun with it and it is an object oriented programming language so I got to design and customize the user interface for it too, it was great!
